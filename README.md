# Employee Management

This project consists of a front page build with VueJs and an API Rest in NodeJS using MongoDB to save the data.

The central idea of this project is to manage employees. You can add, delete, edit and view employees.

In order for the user to access the main page to carry out these operations, it is necessary to register in the system with email, name and password.
